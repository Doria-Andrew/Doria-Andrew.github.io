JavaScript Objects are data types like the seven primitive data types: strings, numbers, booleans, etc.

JavaScript Objects are containers storing related data and functionality.

An object in HavaScript is self-contained set of related values and functions.

One way to think about an object is that it's like a dictionary where you look up a property name and see a value.

property = an attribute of something
value = quantity, number, noun, thing

It's like a database of values. They are much more flexible, as they can ve employed to encapsulate code that can be reused throughout a program.

Objects are often used to keep any related info and functionality together in the same place. Foe example, if you wrote functions that found the perimeter and area of a square, you might want to group them togeher as methodsa of the same object that also included a length property.

Object Example:

let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
  }
  
  In this example, spaceship is the object, 'Fuel Type' and color are the the keys, 'diesel' and 'silver' are the values. The properties are 'Fuel Type': 'diesel': color: 'silver'
